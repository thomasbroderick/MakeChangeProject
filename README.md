# Make Change Project

## Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

Overview

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

How to use
MakeChangeApp contains object creation and object method to initialize the program.  User inputs an amount owed and an amount tendered that then goes through a logic loop to determine how to proceed if what's tendered is less than, equal to, or more than the amount owed.  The second method then uses division/modulus functions as part of a for loop over an array of values to determine how many of each type of currency to put into the array that's passed to the final method which runs that array over a second array to get the final output.
